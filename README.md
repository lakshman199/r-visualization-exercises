This repository contains Module 2: Data Visualization exercises for the course Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSA 5200).
The tasks focus on exploring R programming and libraries like ggplot2 and paletteer to create meaningful data visualizations.
Contents

Activity 1 – Creating sequential color palettes using paletteer and displaying as a colormap.
Activity 2 – Working with datasets and displaying structured outputs.
Activity 3 – Exploring different visualization techniques with ggplot2.
Activity 4 – Using advanced palette customization and theme settings.
Activity 5 – Final integration of datasets and visualizations for analysis.
